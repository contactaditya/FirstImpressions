<br /><br /> <h3 style ="text-align:center"> <b> Instructions for the Study </b> </h3> <br /><br />
     
    <b>Now, look at some pictures and record your reactions to them ...</b> <br /><br />

For each person, you'll see one or more pictures that he or she has decided to show us. <br /><br />

You will be asked to rate the trustworthiness and the creditworthiness of the person, based on such pictures. The rating will be on a scale going from extremely creditworthy/trustworthy to not creditworthy/trustworthy at all. <br /> <br />

You will also be asked a background question about the attractiveness of the person in the picture. Similarly to the ratings above, the scale will go from extremely attractive for age to not attractive at all. <br /> <br />

Each picture will remain on the screen a minimum of 5 seconds, so that you can look at it carefully before rating it. <br /> <br />
